# OpenJij Tutorial

Welcome to OpenJij Tutorial!

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use quantum annealing and other annealing algorithms using OpenJij.
You'll also learn how to use D-Wave Leap, which currently (2019/5) provides a quantum annealing device that can only be used for 1 minute/month, and collaborate with OpenJij.
